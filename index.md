### Intrinsic Dimension of Data Representations in Deep Networks


What happens to the data when it goes into a deep neural network? 

We focused on one particular aspect: the *intrinsic dimensionality* of data representations
inside convolutional networks.

Look inside our [code and tutorials](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep) for a brief
description or at our [**NeurIPS 2019** paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12784) for more details.
