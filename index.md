[Decision Images](https://github.com/ansuini/sparse_logreg)

In an object recognition task not all the pixels are equally important
for decision.
The technique of Decision Images elucidates which parts of the 
visual space (or more in general which features) are really
used to recognize complex shapes. 
The model is a pixel-wise logistic regression. Since the dimensionality
of the model is high (number of pixels + bias term) the model
is regularized with a sparsity term.
