### Intrinsic Dimension of Data Representations in Deep Networks


What happens to the input data when it is fed to a deep neural network? 
We focused on one particular aspect: the intrinsic dimensionality of data representations
inside convolutional networks.

Look inside our [code and tutorials](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep)
and at our [**NeurIPS 2019** paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12784).
